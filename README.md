I built this project back in February and I finally managed to make some time to share it with you guys now - my most sophisticated project to date: Aroma Dating App!

A production ready end-to-end mobile application for dating built up right from scratch; even the most minute animations! ✨️

<hr/>

The product includes:

✅️ Complete user login and authentication

✅️ Extensive catalog of prompts, interests and personality

✅️ Fresh and redefining intuitive UI/UX with modern styling and fluid animations!

✅️ Seperate messaging service

✅️ Super swipe

✅️ Premium subscription

✅️ Most importantly, a working business model.


Since I used React Native to develop this, it supports both ios and android devices. Designing it from bottom-up gave me the power to leverage React Native's latest tools to optimize each and every single swipe seperately for both the platforms.

I further want to invite anybody interested in taking this project further in a closed collaboration. Here is my UI's Figma file for inspiration: https://www.figma.com/design/ecde21uSthiCiIKKL8Zx7X/aroma-ideas?t=Cs2SoobpMkqimkfX-1
